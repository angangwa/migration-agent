      "# Comprehensive Report\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Codebase Analysis Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "### Project Overview\n",
      "- **Name:** consultation_analyser  \n",
      "- **Primary Framework:** Django (Python)  \n",
      "- **Purpose:**  \n",
      "  - A platform to collect, analyse, and display results of “consultations” (surveys, user feedback).  \n",
      "  - Provides both end-user and support-staff interfaces.  \n",
      "  - Embeds NLP functionality (via `embeddings.py`) to generate vector representations of responses, likely for search or summarisation.  \n",
      "  - Exposes a REST API, web UIs (Django + Jinja2), and static component library (“lit” web components).\n",
      "\n",
      "### High-Level Architecture\n",
      "1. **Backend (Django)**  \n",
      "   - **Apps:**  \n",
      "     - `authentication`: User/auth models + migrations.  \n",
      "     - `consultations`: Core domain logic: models, views, APIs, import/export schemas, Jinja2 templates for consultations UI.  \n",
      "     - `email`: Outbound email functionality for sending invites, magic links.  \n",
      "     - `error_pages`: Custom 404/500 pages.  \n",
      "     - `support_console`: Support-staff interface to ingest and manage consultations.  \n",
      "     - `lit`: A library of reusable Lit-based web components for both CSR (client-side render) and SSR examples.  \n",
      "   - **Settings:** `settings/base.py`, `local.py`, `production.py`, `test.py`. Uses `environ` to load `.env`.  \n",
      "   - **Middleware & Context Processors:** Custom middleware, global context processors.  \n",
      "   - **Management Commands:** Custom Django commands (e.g., dummy data, export themes).  \n",
      "   - **Embedding Pipeline:** `embeddings.py` generates vector embeddings for survey text.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Frontend Proxy**  \n",
      "   - **Directory:** `frontend/`  \n",
      "   - **Tech:** Node.js + Express + `http-proxy-middleware`  \n",
      "   - **Purpose:** Acts as a simple proxy for the Django app (possibly to handle CORS or static asset hosting).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Legacy Frontend**  \n",
      "   - Static assets, SCSS, and JS bundles supporting an older version of the UI.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Infrastructure-as-Code**  \n",
      "   - **Directory:** `infrastructure/`  \n",
      "   - **IaC Tool:** Terraform  \n",
      "   - **Resources:** ECR, ECS, Lambda, EventBridge, S3, Postgres RDS, ElastiCache, SQS, IAM, Load Balancer, Secrets Manager.  \n",
      "   - Clear separation between universal modules and environment-specific TF files.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Serverless Lambdas**  \n",
      "   - **Directory:** `lambda/`  \n",
      "   - **Functions:**  \n",
      "     - `slack_notifier.py`: Send Slack notifications.  \n",
      "     - `submit_batch_job.py`: Likely submits batch jobs for heavy data processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Data Pipelines**  \n",
      "   - **pipeline-mapping/**: Docker container + Python script to map data (YAML → internal schema).  \n",
      "   - **pipeline-sign-off/**: Docker container + Python script to handle sign-off processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Testing**  \n",
      "   - **Unit & Helpers:** `tests/commands`, `tests/helpers.py`, `tests/utils.py`.  \n",
      "   - **Integration:** 17 tests under `tests/integration/` covering user flows, page rendering, support console actions, export functionality.  \n",
      "   - **Migration Tests:** `migration_tests/` to ensure data migrations behave as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Findings\n",
      "- **Domain:** Consultation management with ML/NLP enhancements.  \n",
      "- **Extensibility:** Pluggable apps, Jinja2 templating layered on top of Django’s templating engine.  \n",
      "- **CI/CD & Ops:** Ready for containerised deployments (infra, Dockerfiles, release scripts).  \n",
      "- **UX Components:** Custom Lit components library for dynamic dashboards, tables, filters, etc.\n",

      "## 2. FileSystemPlugin Tool Effectiveness Report\n",
      "\n",
      "We systematically tested each of the five FileSystemPlugin functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **list_directory**  \n",
      "   - *Usage:* Hierarchical overview of directories.  \n",
      "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
      "     - Clear tree output with file/dir counts.  \n",
      "     - `max_depth` controls verbosity; `include_hidden` supported.  \n",
      "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
      "     - Depth parameter must be string; minor type confusion.  \n",
      "     - Large trees can still hit token limits; summary truncates deeper levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **find_files**  \n",
      "   - *Usage:* Glob-based file discovery (e.g., `**/*.py`, `**/*.tf`).  \n",
      "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
      "     - Fast, pattern-based filtering.  \n",
      "     - Returns count, truncation status, and suggestions.  \n",
      "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
      "     - Results truncated at 100 by default; must specify narrower patterns or increase `max_results`.  \n",
      "     - No built-in exclude patterns demonstration shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **get_file_info**  \n",
      "   - *Usage:* Retrieves metadata and preview of a single file.  \n",
      "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
      "     - Returns semantic file type (config, text), human-readable size, truncated previews.  \n",
      "     - Offers suggestions for next actions (e.g., parse configs).  \n",
      "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
      "     - Preview limited by default lines; unclear if configurable beyond preview_lines.  \n",
      "     - Does not include checksums or detailed permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **read_file**  \n",
      "   - *Usage:* Reads full or partial content based on line ranges.  \n",
      "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
      "     - Supports `start_line` and `num_lines`.  \n",
      "     - Returns `line_range`, total_lines, truncation info.  \n",
      "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
      "     - Default `/100` lines for large files might truncate unexpectedly.  \n",
      "     - No direct binary vs. text auto-detection beyond error messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **search_in_files**  \n",
      "   - *Usage:* Regex search across multiple file patterns with contextual lines.  \n",
      "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
      "     - Grouped by file, includes before/after context.  \n",
      "     - Summarises total matches and files.  \n",
      "     - Suggestions to refine regex.  \n",
      "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
      "     - Default `max_results=50` can truncate in large codebases.  \n",
      "     - Case sensitivity toggle available, but mixed-case patterns may require careful flags.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Tool Tests & Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "- **list_directory('.' , max_depth=4)**  \n",
      "  - Quickly enumerated 83 directories, 230 files in root.  \n",
      "  - Helpful suggestions to refine subsequent searches.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **find_files('**/*.py')**  \n",
      "  - Located 188 Python files (truncated to first 50).  \n",
      "  - Suggestion: use narrower patterns (e.g., `**/models.py`).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **get_file_info('frontend/package.json')**  \n",
      "  - Returned type=config, size=363 B, first 10 lines preview, and parsing suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **read_file('manage.py', start_line=1, num_lines=200)**  \n",
      "  - Successfully read 27 lines, indicated end-of-file.  \n",
      "  - Clear structure of Django entrypoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **search_in_files('TODO', file_patterns=['**/*.py','**/*.js'])**  \n",
      "  - Found 12 TODOs across 4 files, including in legacy frontend JS.  \n",
      "  - Contextual `before`/`after` lines assist in triaging technical debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Token Efficiency & Usefulness\n",
      "- All tools provide concise, structured outputs with minimal redundancy.  \n",
      "- Suggestions accompanying results guide next exploration steps.  \n",
      "- Truncation warnings prevent oversaturation of tokens, though require manual parameter tuning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Assessment\n",
      "- The FileSystemPlugin suite is **highly effective** for codebase discovery and targeted inspection.  \n",
      "- Minor enhancements (e.g., smarter auto-expand for large files, built-in exclude patterns) would further streamline deep dives.  \n",
      "- In practice, combining `list_directory`, `find_files`, `read_file`, and `search_in_files` in iterative loops rapidly builds up a mental model of complex projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**  \n",
      "We have fully mapped and analysed the “consultation_analyser” ecosystem—spanning Django backends, Node.js frontends, Terraform infrastructure, and testing pipelines. The FileSystemPlugin tools prove powerful for exploratory tasks, with clear outputs and actionable suggestions.\n",

       "\n",
       "## 1. Codebase Analysis Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "### Project Overview\n",
       "- **Name:** consultation_analyser  \n",
       "- **Primary Framework:** Django (Python)  \n",
       "- **Purpose:**  \n",
       "  - A platform to collect, analyse, and display results of “consultations” (surveys, user feedback).  \n",
       "  - Provides both end-user and support-staff interfaces.  \n",
       "  - Embeds NLP functionality (via `embeddings.py`) to generate vector representations of responses, likely for search or summarisation.  \n",
       "  - Exposes a REST API, web UIs (Django + Jinja2), and static component library (“lit” web components).\n",
       "\n",
       "### High-Level Architecture\n",
       "1. **Backend (Django)**  \n",
       "   - **Apps:**  \n",
       "     - `authentication`: User/auth models + migrations.  \n",
       "     - `consultations`: Core domain logic: models, views, APIs, import/export schemas, Jinja2 templates for consultations UI.  \n",
       "     - `email`: Outbound email functionality for sending invites, magic links.  \n",
       "     - `error_pages`: Custom 404/500 pages.  \n",
       "     - `support_console`: Support-staff interface to ingest and manage consultations.  \n",
       "     - `lit`: A library of reusable Lit-based web components for both CSR (client-side render) and SSR examples.  \n",
       "   - **Settings:** `settings/base.py`, `local.py`, `production.py`, `test.py`. Uses `environ` to load `.env`.  \n",
       "   - **Middleware & Context Processors:** Custom middleware, global context processors.  \n",
       "   - **Management Commands:** Custom Django commands (e.g., dummy data, export themes).  \n",
       "   - **Embedding Pipeline:** `embeddings.py` generates vector embeddings for survey text.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Frontend Proxy**  \n",
       "   - **Directory:** `frontend/`  \n",
       "   - **Tech:** Node.js + Express + `http-proxy-middleware`  \n",
       "   - **Purpose:** Acts as a simple proxy for the Django app (possibly to handle CORS or static asset hosting).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Legacy Frontend**  \n",
       "   - Static assets, SCSS, and JS bundles supporting an older version of the UI.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Infrastructure-as-Code**  \n",
       "   - **Directory:** `infrastructure/`  \n",
       "   - **IaC Tool:** Terraform  \n",
       "   - **Resources:** ECR, ECS, Lambda, EventBridge, S3, Postgres RDS, ElastiCache, SQS, IAM, Load Balancer, Secrets Manager.  \n",
       "   - Clear separation between universal modules and environment-specific TF files.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Serverless Lambdas**  \n",
       "   - **Directory:** `lambda/`  \n",
       "   - **Functions:**  \n",
       "     - `slack_notifier.py`: Send Slack notifications.  \n",
       "     - `submit_batch_job.py`: Likely submits batch jobs for heavy data processing.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Data Pipelines**  \n",
       "   - **pipeline-mapping/**: Docker container + Python script to map data (YAML → internal schema).  \n",
       "   - **pipeline-sign-off/**: Docker container + Python script to handle sign-off processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Testing**  \n",
       "   - **Unit & Helpers:** `tests/commands`, `tests/helpers.py`, `tests/utils.py`.  \n",
       "   - **Integration:** 17 tests under `tests/integration/` covering user flows, page rendering, support console actions, export functionality.  \n",
       "   - **Migration Tests:** `migration_tests/` to ensure data migrations behave as expected.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Findings\n",
       "- **Domain:** Consultation management with ML/NLP enhancements.  \n",
       "- **Extensibility:** Pluggable apps, Jinja2 templating layered on top of Django’s templating engine.  \n",
       "- **CI/CD & Ops:** Ready for containerised deployments (infra, Dockerfiles, release scripts).  \n",
       "- **UX Components:** Custom Lit components library for dynamic dashboards, tables, filters, etc.\n",

       "## 2. FileSystemPlugin Tool Effectiveness Report\n",
       "\n",
       "We systematically tested each of the five FileSystemPlugin functions:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **list_directory**  \n",
       "   - *Usage:* Hierarchical overview of directories.  \n",
       "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
       "     - Clear tree output with file/dir counts.  \n",
       "     - `max_depth` controls verbosity; `include_hidden` supported.  \n",
       "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
       "     - Depth parameter must be string; minor type confusion.  \n",
       "     - Large trees can still hit token limits; summary truncates deeper levels.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **find_files**  \n",
       "   - *Usage:* Glob-based file discovery (e.g., `**/*.py`, `**/*.tf`).  \n",
       "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
       "     - Fast, pattern-based filtering.  \n",
       "     - Returns count, truncation status, and suggestions.  \n",
       "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
       "     - Results truncated at 100 by default; must specify narrower patterns or increase `max_results`.  \n",
       "     - No built-in exclude patterns demonstration shown.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **get_file_info**  \n",
       "   - *Usage:* Retrieves metadata and preview of a single file.  \n",
       "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
       "     - Returns semantic file type (config, text), human-readable size, truncated previews.  \n",
       "     - Offers suggestions for next actions (e.g., parse configs).  \n",
       "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
       "     - Preview limited by default lines; unclear if configurable beyond preview_lines.  \n",
       "     - Does not include checksums or detailed permissions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **read_file**  \n",
       "   - *Usage:* Reads full or partial content based on line ranges.  \n",
       "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
       "     - Supports `start_line` and `num_lines`.  \n",
       "     - Returns `line_range`, total_lines, truncation info.  \n",
       "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
       "     - Default `/100` lines for large files might truncate unexpectedly.  \n",
       "     - No direct binary vs. text auto-detection beyond error messages.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **search_in_files**  \n",
       "   - *Usage:* Regex search across multiple file patterns with contextual lines.  \n",
       "   - *Strengths:*  \n",
       "     - Grouped by file, includes before/after context.  \n",
       "     - Summarises total matches and files.  \n",
       "     - Suggestions to refine regex.  \n",
       "   - *Limitations:*  \n",
       "     - Default `max_results=50` can truncate in large codebases.  \n",
       "     - Case sensitivity toggle available, but mixed-case patterns may require careful flags.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example Tool Tests & Observations\n",
       "\n",
       "- **list_directory('.' , max_depth=4)**  \n",
       "  - Quickly enumerated 83 directories, 230 files in root.  \n",
       "  - Helpful suggestions to refine subsequent searches.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **find_files('**/*.py')**  \n",
       "  - Located 188 Python files (truncated to first 50).  \n",
       "  - Suggestion: use narrower patterns (e.g., `**/models.py`).\n",
       "\n",
       "- **get_file_info('frontend/package.json')**  \n",
       "  - Returned type=config, size=363 B, first 10 lines preview, and parsing suggestions.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **read_file('manage.py', start_line=1, num_lines=200)**  \n",
       "  - Successfully read 27 lines, indicated end-of-file.  \n",
       "  - Clear structure of Django entrypoint.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **search_in_files('TODO', file_patterns=['**/*.py','**/*.js'])**  \n",
       "  - Found 12 TODOs across 4 files, including in legacy frontend JS.  \n",
       "  - Contextual `before`/`after` lines assist in triaging technical debt.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Token Efficiency & Usefulness\n",
       "- All tools provide concise, structured outputs with minimal redundancy.  \n",
       "- Suggestions accompanying results guide next exploration steps.  \n",
       "- Truncation warnings prevent oversaturation of tokens, though require manual parameter tuning.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Overall Assessment\n",
       "- The FileSystemPlugin suite is **highly effective** for codebase discovery and targeted inspection.  \n",
       "- Minor enhancements (e.g., smarter auto-expand for large files, built-in exclude patterns) would further streamline deep dives.  \n",
       "- In practice, combining `list_directory`, `find_files`, `read_file`, and `search_in_files` in iterative loops rapidly builds up a mental model of complex projects.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion:**  \n",
       "We have fully mapped and analysed the “consultation_analyser” ecosystem—spanning Django backends, Node.js frontends, Terraform infrastructure, and testing pipelines. The FileSystemPlugin tools prove powerful for exploratory tasks, with clear outputs and actionable suggestions."

High-Level Overview\\nThis repository implements **Consultation Analyser**, a full-stack platform for ingesting, hosting, and analysing public consultation data. Its primary components are:\\n\\n- **Django Backend** (`consultation_analyser/`):\\n  - Core application providing authentication (magic links), REST APIs, support console, email notifications, and HTML/Jinja2 views.\\n  - Uses Django 5.0, Django-RQ for background jobs, Postgres with connection pooling, feature flags (waffle), Simple History, DRF, and Django Filters.\\n  - Templates rendered via Jinja2 (for the new Lit-based components) and standard Django templates (legacy pages).\\n\\n- **Lit Web Components** (`consultation_analyser/lit/` + `frontend/` + `legacy-frontend/`):\\n  - New UI built as Lit components (CSR + SSR examples) compiled via Node/Express (`frontend/server.js`).\\n  - Legacy front-end assets (SCSS, GOV.UK assets, custom JS) maintained under `legacy-frontend/`.\\n\\n- **Data Pipelines**:\\n  - **Pipeline Mapping** (`pipeline-mapping/`): Dockerized script to map imported consultation data to internal schema.\\n  - **Pipeline Sign-off** (`pipeline-sign-off/`): Script for manual sign-off of processed data.\\n\\n- **AWS Infrastructure as Code** (`infrastructure/`):\\n  - Terraform definitions for ECS, ECR, Lambda, S3, Postgres RDS, ElastiCache, EventBridge, SQS, IAM, and other resources.\\n  - CI/CD and release scripts under `infrastructure/scripts/`.\\n\\n- **Lambda Functions** (`lambda/`):\\n  - `submit_batch_job.py`: Triggers AWS Batch jobs for ingestion or processing.\\n  - `slack_notifier.py`: Sends Slack alerts on job failures or notifications.\\n\\n- **Tests**:\\n  - **Unit/Migration Tests** (`migration_tests/`): Validate historic migrations.\\n  - **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): End-to-end testing of UI flows and APIs.\\n  - **Support Scripts** (`tests/commands/`, `tests/helpers.py`, etc.).\\n\\n- **Documentation** (`docs/`):\\n  - Architectural decisions, ERD diagram, Lit guide, etc.\\n\\n## 2. Key Architecture Points\\n\\n- **Monorepo Structure**: Combines backend, frontend, infra, and data-pipeline code.\\n- **Django Settings**: Split by environment (`base.py`, `local.py`, `production.py`, `test.py`), loading secrets via `environ`.\\n- **Templating**:\\n  - Jinja2 for new UI; environment configured via `consultation_analyser/jinja2.py`.\\n  - Standard Django templates for legacy pages.\\n- **Static Assets**: Served via WhiteNoise and S3; legacy frontend output directed into `staticfiles.json`.\\n- **Background Processing**: Django-RQ and AWS Batch for long-running tasks.\\n- **Authentication**: Custom `User` model in `authentication/models.py` with magic-link login flows.\\n- **Support Console**: Admin-style interface for ingesting data and managing user access.\\n- **Embeddings**: Code to generate embeddings (`consultation_analyser/embeddings.py`) for AI-driven analysis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# FileSystemPlugin Tool Effectiveness Report\\n\\nWe systematically tested **all** FileSystemPlugin functions with a variety of scenarios.

High-Level Overview\\nThis repository implements **Consultation Analyser**, a full-stack platform for ingesting, hosting, and analysing public consultation data. Its primary components are:\\n\\n- **Django Backend** (`consultation_analyser/`):\\n  - Core application providing authentication (magic links), REST APIs, support console, email notifications, and HTML/Jinja2 views.\\n  - Uses Django 5.0, Django-RQ for background jobs, Postgres with connection pooling, feature flags (waffle), Simple History, DRF, and Django Filters.\\n  - Templates rendered via Jinja2 (for the new Lit-based components) and standard Django templates (legacy pages).\\n\\n- **Lit Web Components** (`consultation_analyser/lit/` + `frontend/` + `legacy-frontend/`):\\n  - New UI built as Lit components (CSR + SSR examples) compiled via Node/Express (`frontend/server.js`).\\n  - Legacy front-end assets (SCSS, GOV.UK assets, custom JS) maintained under `legacy-frontend/`.\\n\\n- **Data Pipelines**:\\n  - **Pipeline Mapping** (`pipeline-mapping/`): Dockerized script to map imported consultation data to internal schema.\\n  - **Pipeline Sign-off** (`pipeline-sign-off/`): Script for manual sign-off of processed data.\\n\\n- **AWS Infrastructure as Code** (`infrastructure/`):\\n  - Terraform definitions for ECS, ECR, Lambda, S3, Postgres RDS, ElastiCache, EventBridge, SQS, IAM, and other resources.\\n  - CI/CD and release scripts under `infrastructure/scripts/`.\\n\\n- **Lambda Functions** (`lambda/`):\\n  - `submit_batch_job.py`: Triggers AWS Batch jobs for ingestion or processing.\\n  - `slack_notifier.py`: Sends Slack alerts on job failures or notifications.\\n\\n- **Tests**:\\n  - **Unit/Migration Tests** (`migration_tests/`): Validate historic migrations.\\n  - **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): End-to-end testing of UI flows and APIs.\\n  - **Support Scripts** (`tests/commands/`, `tests/helpers.py`, etc.).\\n\\n- **Documentation** (`docs/`):\\n  - Architectural decisions, ERD diagram, Lit guide, etc.\\n\\n## 2.
