    "# FileSystemPlugin AI Agent Testing with Enhanced Group Chat Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Updates**: This notebook has been significantly enhanced with robust improvements for production-ready agent orchestration:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🆕 Key Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Robust Message Tracking & Session Management**\n",
    "- **Timestamped outputs**: All runs save to unique files like `agent_responses_2024-01-27_15-30-45_run_abc123.json`\n",
    "- **Session management**: Each session gets a unique ID with comprehensive metadata tracking\n",
    "- **Auto-reset**: Messages automatically reset between runs with user confirmation\n",
    "- **Error recovery**: Comprehensive error handling ensures data is never lost\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Generic Termination System**\n",
    "- **Flexible criteria**: Termination prompts adapt to any agent task, not just codebase analysis\n",
    "- **Task-agnostic**: Works for any general-purpose agent responsibility\n",
    "- **Configurable objectives**: Support for single or multiple completion criteria\n",
    "- **Progress tracking**: Intelligent evaluation of task completion status\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Dual-Agent Architecture**\n",
    "- **Original Agent**: `CodebaseAnalysisAndTestingAgent` - Focuses on codebase analysis + FileSystemPlugin tool testing\n",
    "- **New Agent**: `CodebaseArchitectureAnalyst` - Deep architectural analysis with Mermaid diagrams\n",
    "- **Complementary analysis**: Two different perspectives on the same codebase\n",
    "- **Comparative insights**: Side-by-side analysis of different approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Advanced Orchestration Features**\n",
    "- **Enhanced callbacks**: Improved logging with timestamps and metadata\n",
    "- **Execution tracking**: Comprehensive run history and performance metrics  \n",
    "- **Error handling**: Graceful failure recovery with detailed error reporting\n",
    "- **Timeout management**: Configurable execution timeouts for long-running tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Architecture Analysis Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The new `CodebaseArchitectureAnalyst` specializes in:\n",
    "- **System architecture documentation** with expert-level analysis\n",
    "- **Mermaid diagram creation** (minimum 3-5 diagrams per analysis)\n",
    "- **Component relationship mapping** and dependency analysis\n",
    "- **Technology stack evaluation** and architectural decision rationale\n",
    "- **End-to-end workflow explanation** with concrete examples\n",
    "- **Scalability and performance considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Production-Ready Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Session isolation**: Each run is completely independent\n",
    "- ✅ **Data persistence**: All conversation data saved with rich metadata\n",
    "- ✅ **Error resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery\n",
    "- ✅ **Flexible configuration**: Easy adaptation to any agent task\n",
    "- ✅ **Performance monitoring**: Execution time and token usage tracking\n",
    "- ✅ **Comparative analysis**: Multiple agent perspectives on the same data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook now serves as a **robust foundation for any general-purpose agent task**, with enterprise-grade reliability and comprehensive analysis capabilities.\n",
